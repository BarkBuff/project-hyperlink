Your own private internet. Runs entirely offline, preloaded with the good parts of the web — Wikipedia, Khan Academy, books, and more.  

No SIM. No ISP. No surveillance.  

Status: This is the **foundation build** — straight from the official PDF instructions, with clean scripts, configs, and docs.  
Upgrades coming in **LibreBox-Extended**.  

Boot it, connect, and browse — anywhere “no internet” isn’t an excuse.
